My first computer game.

This is my first computer game. Two players can play this over TCP/IP protocol.
When open, the player can chose to be server or client.Server means that he holds all the cards, and client means he will
get cards from the server.
If the player choose to be server, a number is generated, that must be passed to the other player.
If the player choose to be client, a text box appear and the number provided be the server must be written inside.

Card must be arranged on the board followind game rules.
